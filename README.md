# Learn CSS:

This will be a walkthrough of different CSS concepts and the models within CSS

# Getting Started With CSS

- You should include the line `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` within `index.html`
- `<link>` element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet
  - `rel` attribute set to `stylesheet` indicates you have a stylsheet
  - `href` tells you the location of the stylesheet

## Changing the default behavior of elements

- Browsers have an internal stylesheet, but sometimes you might want to change it to your own desired setting
- To do this, you will need to specify your own CSS rules to override them
  - Ex: `li { list-style-type: none; }`

## Adding a Class

- So far, we've styled elements based on their names, but that's only if want all of them to be exactly the same
- Here, we need to add a `class` attribute
- In the CSS, you target the `class` by creating a selector that starts with `.`
- Somtimes, you can chain the selectors:
  - `.li.special {}`
  - This means target any `li` elements that has the class `special`
- Specifying other elements requires you to chain the selectors again:
  - `li.special, span.special {}`

## Styling things based on their location in a document

- For example, in the CSS for this section, we have an `<em>` element within an `li` element
  - To specify that, we can use `li em`
- This is called a **descendant combinator**, and takes the form of a space between two other selectors
- Something else that might also be common is to style a paragraph that comes directly after a heading
  - To do so, use `h1 + p {}`
- This is called an **adjacent sibling combinator**

## Styling things based on state

- Straight-forward example of this is styling links
- Links have different state depending whether it's been visited or not, being hovered over, focused via keyboard, etc.
- You can use CSS to target these different states
- Examples in the CSS file:
  - `a:link`, `a:visited`, `a:hover`

## Combining selectors and combinators

- You can also combine selectors and combinators
- Ex: `article p span {}`, selects any span that's inside a paragraph that's inside an article
- Ex: `h1 + ul + p`, selects any `p` tags that are after a `ul` that's after an `h1`
- `body h1 + p .special {}`, any `.special` classes that's within a `p` tag that follows an `h1` that's within the body.

# How is CSS structured?

## Applying CSS to HTML

There are three ways to apply CSS to HTML:

- External stylesheet
  - Contains CSS in a separate file with `.css` extension
  - Reference an external CSS stylesheet with `<link>` tag
  - Ex: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />`
  - `href` needs to be reference a file on your file system
- Internal stylesheet
  - Resides within an HTML document
  - Place CSS inside `<style>` element contained inside HTML `<head>`
  - Internal CSS might be useful in some circumstances, such as a content management system where you can't access the external CSS files
  - However, for sites with more than one page, it's not a good idea to use internal styling because you will need internal styling for every web page.
- Inline styles
  - CSS declaratons that affect a single element
  - Contained within a `style` attributev
  - **Avoid using CSS in this way, when possible.**
  - Least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance
  - There are few circumstances where this is common:
    - Ex: HTML email to achieve compatibility with as many clients as possible
    - Ex: CMS only allows you edit the HTML body

### Selectors

Selector targets HTML to apply styles to content. If CSS is not applying the way you expected, then your selector may not match the way you think it should match.

- `h1`
- `a:link`
- `.manythings`
- `#onething`
- `*`
- `.box p`
- `.box p:first-child`
- `h1, h2, .intro`

#### Specificity

- Two selectors might select the same HTML element

```
.special {
  color: red;
}

p {
  color: blue;
}
```

- In our HTML, we have the following element: `<p> class="special">What color am I?</p>`
- We're unsure of whether the paragraph should be blue or red
- CSS language has rules that controls which selector is stronger
  - Called **casacde** and **specificity**
- In the example above, the paragraph will be blue, because the declaration that sets the text to blue appears layer in the stylesheet.
- **Cascading**: Later styles replace conflicting styles that appear earlier in the stylesheet
- **Specificity**: Class is rated as more specific than the element selector, so it cancels the other conflicting style declaration

```
p {
  color: red;
}

p {
  color: blue;
}
```

### Properties and Values

- Properties:
  - Human readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify
  - Ex: `font-size`, `width`, `background-color`
- Values:
  - Each property is assigned a value, this value indicates how to style the property
- When a property is paired with a value, this pairing is called a _CSS declaration_
- _CSS declarations_ are found within _CSS declaration blocks_
- _CSS declaration blocks_ are paired with _selectors_ to produce _CSS rulesets_ or _CSS rules_
- CSS properties and values are case-insensitive, and the pair is separated by a colon (`:`)

#### Functions

- There are some values that take the form of a function
- Ex: `calc()`

HTML:

```
<div class="outer">
 <div class="box">
   The inner box is 90% - 30px.
 </div>
</div>
```

CSS:

```
.outer {
  border: 5px solid black;
}

.box {
  padding: 10px;
  width: calc(90% - 30px);
  background-color: rebeccapurple;
  color: white;
}
```

- Function consists of the function name, and parentheses to enclose the values for the function.
- In the example, it's defined as 90% of the containing block width minus 30 pixels.

#### Transform Functions

- Ex: rotate()

HTML:

```
<div class="box"></div>
```

CSS:

```
.box {
  margin: 30px;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: rebeccapurple;
  transform: rotate(0.8turn);
}
```

### @rules

- Pronounced "at-rules", provide instructions for what the CSS should perform or how it should behave.
- Ex: `@import` imports a stylesheet into another CSS stylesheet

  - `@import "styles2.css"`
    One common @rule is `@media`, which is used to create media queries, which use conditional logic for applying CSS styling

- The stylesheet below defines a pink background for the `<body>` element, but the media query defines a blue background if the viewport is wider than 30em

CSS:

```
body {
  background-color: pink;
}

@media (min-width: 30em) {
  body {
    background-color: blue;
  }
}
```

### Shorthands

- Some properties are called **shorthand properties**, because we can set several values in a single line

- Padding and margin, shorthand is applied in the order top, right, bottom, left (clockwise from the top)
- There are also two-value shorthands, which set for top/bottom, left/right
  - Ex: `padding: 10px 15px 15px 5px;`

### Comments

- As with any coding work, it's best practice to write comments along the CSS, begins with `/*` and ends with `*/`

### White space

- White space means actual spaces, tabs, and new lines
- Browsers will ignore white space inside CSS, its value is in improving readability
- Each declaration (and rule start/end) has its own line. This is arguably a good way to write CSS.
- **Property names never have white spaces**

## How CSS works?

We will consider how the browser takes CSS and HTML and turns it into a webpage.

### How does CSS actually work?

- The browser must combine the document's content with its styling information

Below is a very simplified version of what actually happens in the background:

1. The browser loads HTML (e.g. receives from the network)
2. Converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory.
3. The browser fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML document, such as embedded images, videos, and even linked CSS, but JavaScript is handled a bit later.
4. The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into different "buckets", e.g. element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and attaches style to them as required (this intermediate step is called a render tree).
5. The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules have been applied to it.
6. The visual display of the page is shown on the screen (this stage is called painting).

![Rendering](/assets/rendering.png)

### About the DOM

- DOM has a tree like structure. Each element, attribute, and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree structure. The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some elements are parents of child nodes, and child nodes have siblings.
- The DOM is where your CSS and the document's content meet up.
- When you start working with browser DevTools you will be navigating the DOM as you select items in order to see which rules apply.

### A real DOM representation

- This is an example that converts HTML to a DOM representation

```
<p>
  Let's use:
  <span>Cascading</span>
  <span>Style</span>
  <span>Sheets</span>
</p>
```

- In the DOM, the node corresponding to `<p>` is the parent, and the children are a text node and three nodes corresponding to `<span>` element

```
P
├─ "Let's use:"
├─ SPAN
|  └─ "Cascading"
├─ SPAN
|  └─ "Style"
└─ SPAN
    └─ "Sheets"
```

### Applying CSS to the DOM

- Looking at the same HTML as above, and we want to apply the following CSS to the document

```
span {
  border: 1px solid black;
  background-color: lime;
}
```

- The browser parses the HTML and creates a DOM from it, then it parses the CSS
- Since the only rule available in the CSS has a span selector, the browser sorts the CSS very quickly! It applies that rule to each one of the three <span>s, then paints the final visual representation to the screen

### What happens if a browser encounters CSS it doesn't understand?

- The answer is that it does nothing and simply moves onto the next declaration
- Similarly, if a browser encounters a selector that it doesn't understand, it will just ignore the whole rule and move on to the next one.
- In the following example, the word color is spelled with British spelling, but only that specific line will marked as invalid

```
p {
  font-weight: bold;
  colour: blue; /* incorrect spelling of the color property */
  font-size: 200%;
}
```

- This behavior is very useful. It means that you can use new CSS as an enhancement, knowing that no error will occur if it is not understood — the browser will either get the new feature or not. This enables basic fallback styling.

- This is a good example with `calc()` function, which some browsers do not understand, and this works particularly well when you want to use a value that is quite new and not supported everywhere.
- For example, some older browsers do not support calc() as a value. I might give a fallback width for a box in pixels, then go on to give a width with a calc() value of 100% - 50px. Old browsers will use the pixel version, ignoring the line about calc() as they don't understand it. New browsers will interpret the line using pixels, but then override it with the line using calc() as that line appears later in the cascade.

```
.box {
  width: 500px;
  width: calc(100% - 50px);
}
```

### Assessment: Styling a Biography Page

-Make the level one heading pink, using the CSS color keyword hotpink.
-Give the heading a 10px dotted border-bottom which uses the CSS color keyword purple.
-Make the level 2 heading italic.
-Give the ul used for the contact details a background-color of #eeeeee, and a 5px solid purple border. Use some padding to push the content away from the border.
-Make the links green on hover.

# CSS Building Blocks

We will look at cacscade and inheritance, all the selector types that are available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and more.

## Cascade and Inheritance

This controls how CSS is applied to HTML and how conflicts between style declarations are resolved.

### Conflicting Rules

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and cascading is really important to understand
- Oftentimes when CSS is not working, it's probably because you've written a rule that overwrote one of the rules
- **Casacde** and **specificity** are mechanisms that control which rule applies when there is such a conflict. The rule that's styling your element may not be the one you expect, so you need to understand how these mechanisms work.
- Also important is the concept of **inheritance**, where elements might take the default values from its parent, but some other elements might not

### Cascade

- Stylesheets **cascade** — at a very simple level, this means that the origin, the cascade layer, and the order of CSS rules matter.
- As an example:

```
<h1>This is my heading.</h1>
```

The CSS are:

```
h1 {
    color: red;
}
h1 {
    color: blue;
}

```

- We have two rules that both apply to the `h1` element, but it ends up being colored blue, because both rules are from the same source, have an identical element selector, and therefore carries the same specificity, but the last one in the source order wins.

### Specificity

- **Specificity** is the algorithm that the browser uses to decide which property value is applied to an element.
- If multiple style blocks have different selectors that configure the same property with different values and target the same values, specificity decides the property value that gets applied to the element
- Basically a measure of how the selector's selection will be :
  - An element selector is less specific; it will select all elements of that type that appear on a page, so it has less weight.
  - A class selector is more specific; it will select only the elements on a page that have a specific class attribute value, so it has more weight.
- As an example:

```
.main-heading {
    color: red;
}

h1 {
    color: blue;
}
```

```
<h1 class="main-heading">This is my heading.</h1>
```

- The `h1` will be colored red because the class selector is more specific than an element selector, despite the element selector being lower than the class selector

### Inheritance

- This is important to understand because some CSS property values set on parent elements are inherited by their child elements, and some aren't.
- For example, if you set `color` attribute on `font-family` of an element, every element inside it will also be styled with that color and font, unless you've applied different color and font values directly to them
- Ex:

```
body {
    color: blue;
}

span {
    color: black;
}
```

```
<p>As the body has been set to have a color of blue this is inherited through the descendants.</p>
<p>We can change the color by targeting the element with a selector, such as this <span>span</span>.</p>
```

- Some values don't inherit, such as `width`. If you set `width` to 50%, all of its descendants don't get a width of 50%
- You will need to check each property's `Formal Definition` to check if it's inherited or not

### Understanding how the concepts work together

- You can use the browser's web tools to inspect a page's specificity, cascade, and more
- Firefox's DevTools are pretty similar to the ones in Chrome, the HTML is basically the DOM structure
- The rules panel is where you see these inheritance rules, etc.
- Cascade works by giving every selector and property a weight, and the weight in combination is what we call specificity
- The first is usually inline styles, which is applied directly to the element
- Then we have the selector block, which has less weight
- If there's a conflict, the one higher up on the list will override the ones lower in the list
- The `id` selector is also more specific than `class` selectors, so they are higher up in the selector
- There are also inherited styles a little lower
  - Main appears before HTML
  - These inherited values will be in the order of distance
- We can also see the browser styles that can be applied, go to settings to enable that, aka _user agent_ styles
- You can also turn on different states like hover, or add additional classes and add it through there
- There's also the computed tab
  - Just the properties that are applied, and for each property, where it came from, and what they are set to

### Understanding inheritance

- We will analyze the following example, the `color` property is an inherited property, so it is applied to direct children as well as indirect children
- Properties like `width`, `margin`, `padding`, and `border` are not inherited, and the reason is because if we increase the border for one element, then every single list and list item will also gain a border, which is definitely not intended

```
.main {
    color: rebeccapurple;
    border: 2px solid #ccc;
    padding: 1em;
}

.special {
    color: black;
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

```
<ul class="main">
    <li>Item One</li>
    <li>Item Two
        <ul>
            <li>2.1</li>
            <li>2.2</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Item Three
        <ul class="special">
            <li>3.1
                <ul>
                    <li>3.1.1</li>
                    <li>3.1.2</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>3.2</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

```

#### Controlling inheritance

- `inherit`: Sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same as that of its parent element. Effectively, this "turns on inheritance".
- `initial`: Sets the property value applied to a selected element to the initial value of that property.
- `revert`: Resets the property value applied to a selected element to the browser's default styling rather than the defaults applied to that property. This value acts like unset in many cases.
- `revert-layer`: Resets the property value applied to a selected element to the value established in a previous cascade layer.
- `unset`: Resets the property to its natural value, which means that if the property is naturally inherited it acts like inherit, otherwise it acts like initial.

#### Resetting all property values

- The CSS shorthand property `all` can be used to apply one of these inheritance values to (almost) all properties at once. Its value can be any one of the inheritance values (`inherit`, `initial`, `revert`, `revert-layer`, or `unset`). It's a convenient way to undo changes made to styles so that you can get back to a known starting point before beginning new changes.

### Understanding the cascade

- We will now look at how cascade defines which CSS rules apply when more than one style block apply the same propety, but with different values, to the same element.
- There are three elements to soncider
  1. Source Order
  2. Specificity
  3. Importance

#### Source Order

- If you have more than one rule, all of which have exactly the same weight, then the one that comes last in the CSS will win.
- You can think of this as the rule that is nearer the element itself overwrites the earlier ones until the last one wins and gets to style the element.
- Source order only matters when the specificty weight of the rules is the same

#### Specificity

- You will often run into a situation where you know that a rule comes later in the stylesheet, but an earlier, conflicting rule is applied. This happens because the earlier rule has a **higher specificity** — it is more specific, and therefore, is being chosen by the browser as the one that should style the element.
- Although we are thinking about selectors and the rules that are applied, it isn't the entire rule that's overwritten, only the properties that are declared in multiple places.
- This behavior helps to avoid repetition in your CSS
  - A common practice is to definte generic styles for the basic elements, and then create classes for those that are different.
- As an example, we will `h1` with a generic styling, and then style the others with classes selectors

```
h2 {
    font-size: 2em;
    color: #000;
    font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
}

.small {
    font-size: 1em;
}

.bright {
    color: rebeccapurple;
}
```

```
<h2>Heading with no class</h2>
<h2 class="small">Heading with class of small</h2>
<h2 class="bright">Heading with class of bright</h2>
```

- How does a browser calculate specificity. Essentially, a value in points is awarded to different types of selectors, and adding these up gives you the weight of that particular selector, which can then be assessed against other potential matches.
- The amount of sepcificity a selector has is measured using three different values (or components), which can thought of as ID, CLASS, and ELEMENT columns in the hundreds, tens, and ones place:
  - **Identifiers**: Score one in this column for each ID selector contained inside the overall selector.
  - **Classes**: Score one in this column for each class selector, attribute selector, or pseudo-class contained inside the overall selector.
  - **Elements**: Score one in this column for each element selector or pseudo-element contained inside the overall selector.

| Selector               | Identifiers | Classes | Elements | Total Specificity |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| `h1 + p::first-letter` | 0           | 0       | 1        | 0-0-1             |

#### Inline styles

- Inlines styles take precedence over all normal styles, no matter the specificity. Their specificity can be continued as 1-0-0-0.

#### !important

- There's a special piece of CSS that you can use to overrule all of the above calculations, even the inline styles, the `!important` flag.
- You should be careful when using it, it is used to make an individual property and value pair the most specific rule, thereby overriding the normal rules of the cascade.
- The only way to override an important declaration is to include another important declaration with the _same specificity_ later in the source order, or one with higher specificity.
- One use case is when you're working on a CMS where you can't edit the CSS modules.

### The effect of CSS location

- It's possible to set custom stylesheets to override the developer's styles.
- It's also possible to declare developer styles in casacde layers: you can make non-layered styles override styles declared in layers or you can make styles declared in later layers override styles from earlier declared layers.
- As a developer, you may not be able to edit a third-party stylesheet, but you can import the external stylesheet into a cascade layer so that all your styles easily override the imported styles without worrying about third-party selector specificity.

#### Order of overriding declarations

Conflicting declarations will be applied in the following order, which later ones overriding earlier ones:

1. Declarations in user agent style sheets (e.g., the browser's default styles, used when no other styling is set).
2. Normal declarations in user style sheets (custom styles set by a user).
3. Normal declarations in author style sheets (these are the styles set by us, the web developers).
4. Important declarations in author style sheets.
5. Important declarations in user style sheets.
6. Important declarations in user agent style sheets.

- Note that the order of precedence is inverted for styles flagged with `!important`

#### Order of cascade layers

- When you declare CSS in cascade layers, the order of precedence is determined by the order in which the layers are declared.
- CSS styles declared outside of any layer are combined together, in the order in which those styles are declared, into an unnamed layer, as if it were the last declared layer.
- With competing normal styles, layer layers take precedence over earlier defined layers, but `!important` flag reverses the order
- Example:

```
@layer firstLayer, secondLayer;

p { /* 0-0-1 */
  background-color: red;
  color: grey !important;
  border: 5px inset purple;
}
p#addSpecificity { /* 1-0-1 */
  border-style: solid !important;
}

@layer firstLayer {
  #addSpecificity { /* 1-0-0 */
    background-color: blue;
    color: white !important;
    border-width: 5px;
    border-style: dashed !important;
  }
}

@layer secondLayer {
  p#addSpecificity { /* 1-0-1 */
    background-color: green;
    color: orange !important;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: dotted !important;
  }
}
```

```
<p id="addSpecificity">
  A paragraph with a border and background
</p>
```

- In here, two layers are defined, `firstLayer` and `secondLayer`
- Even though secondLayer is the highest, no properties from that declarations are used, because non-layered normal styles take precedence over layered normal styles, no matter the specificity, and important layered styles take precedence over important styles declared in layer layers.

# CSS Selectors

- CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements on the web page, there are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine-grained precision when selecting elements to style

## What is a selector?

- It's the first part of the CSS rule, a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected.
- The element or elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the _subject of the selector_.
- In CSS, selectors are defined in the CSS Selectors specification; like any other part of CSS they need to have support in browsers for them to work. The majority of selectors that you will come across are defined in the [Level 3 Selectors specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/).

## Selector lists

- If you have more than one thing which uses the same CSS then the individual selectors can be combined into a selector list so that the rule is applied to all of the individual selectors.
- Ex:

```
h1 {
  color: blue;
}

.special {
  color: blue;
}
```

- Can be combined into:

```
h1,
.special {
  color: blue;
}
```

- In the following example, the invalid class selector rule will be ignored, whereas the h1 would still be styled.

```
h1 {
  color: blue;
}

..special {
  color: blue;
}
```

- When combined however, neither the h1 nor the class will be styled as the entire rule is deemed invalid.

```
h1, ..special {
  color: blue;
}
```

## Types of selectors

- There are a few different groupings of selectors, and knowing which type of selector you might need will help you to find the right tool for the job.

### Type, class, and ID selectors

- This group includes selectors that target an HTML element such as an `<h1>`.

```
h1 {
}
```

- It also includes selectors which target a class:

```
.box {
}
```

- or, an ID:

```
#unique {
}
```

### Attribute selectors

- This group of selectors give you different ways to select elements based on the presence of a certain attribute on an element

```
a[title] {
}
```

- Or even make a selection based on the presence of an attribute with a particular value:

```
a[href="https://example.com"]
{
}
```

### Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements:

- This group of selectors includes pseudo-classes, which style certain states of an element. The :hover pseudo-class for example selects an element only when it is being hovered over by the mouse pointer:

```
a:hover {
}
```

- It also includes pseudo-elements, which select a certain part of an element rather than the element itself. For example, `::first-line` always selects the first line of text inside an element (a `<p>` in the below case), acting as if a `<span>` was wrapped around the first formatted line and then selected.

```
p::first-line {
}
```

### Combinators

The final group of selectors combine other selectors in order to target elements within our documents. The following, for example, selects paragraphs that are direct children of `<article>` elements using the child combinator (`>`):

```
article > p {
}
```

# The box model

- Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create more complex layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items.

## Block and inline boxes

- In CSS we broadly have two types of boxes — **block boxes** and **inline boxes**. The type refers to how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in relation to other boxes on the page. Boxes have an **inner display type** and an **outer display type**.
- In general, you can set various values for the display type using the `display` property, which can have various values.

## Outer display type

- If a box has an outer display type of `block`, then:
  - The box will break onto a new line.
  - The `width` and `height` properties are respected.
  - Padding, margin, and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box.
  - The box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container. In most cases, the box will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space available.
- Some HTML elements such as `<h1>` and `<p>` use `block` as their outer display type by default.

- If a box has an outer display type of `inline`, then:
  - The box will not break onto a new line.
  - The width and height properties will not apply.
  - Vertical padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.
  - Horizontal padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.
- Some HTML elements, such as `<a>`, `<span>`, `<em>` and `<strong>` use inline as their outer display type by default.

## Inner display type

- Boxes also have an inner display type, which dictates how elements inside that box are laid out.
- Block and inline layout is the default way things behave on the web. By default and without any other instruction, the elements inside a box are also laid out in `normal flow` and behave as block or inline boxes.
- You can change the inner display type by setting `display: flex` for example.
- The element will still use the outer display type `block` but this changes the inner display type to `flex`.
- Any direct children of this box will become flex items and behave according to the Flexbox specification.
- Another inner display type is `grid`.

## Examples of different display types

- Here are three exampels:
  - A paragraph with a border added in CSS. The browser renders this as a block box. The paragraph starts on a new line and extends the entire available width.
  - A list, which is laid out using `display: flex`. This establishes flex layout for the children of the container, which are flex items. The list itself is a block box and — like the paragraph — expands to the full container width and breaks onto a new line.
  - A block-level paragraph, inside which are two `<span>` elements. These elements would normally be `inline`, however, one of the elements has a class of "block" which gets set to display: block.

```
p,
ul {
  border: 2px solid rebeccapurple;
  padding: .5em;
}

.block,
li {
  border: 2px solid blue;
  padding: .5em;
}

ul {
  display: flex;
  list-style: none;
}

.block {
  display: block;
}
```

```
<p>I am a paragraph. A short one.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Item One</li>
  <li>Item Two</li>
  <li>Item Three</li>
</ul>
<p>I am another paragraph. Some of the <span class="block">words</span> have been wrapped in a <span>span element</span>.</p>
```

- Here's an example of how `inline` elements behave:
  - The `<span>` elements in the first paragraph are inline by default and so do not force line breaks.
  - The `<ul>` element that is set to `display: inline-flex` creates an inline box containing some flex items.
  - The two paragraphs are both set to `display: inline`. The inline flex container and paragraphs all run together on one line rather than breaking onto new lines (as they would do if they were displaying as block-level elements).

```
p,
ul {
  border: 2px solid rebeccapurple;
}

span,
li {
  border: 2px solid blue;
}

ul {
  display: inline-flex;
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
}

.inline {
  display: inline;
}
```

```
<p>
    I am a paragraph. Some of the
    <span>words</span> have been wrapped in a
    <span>span element</span>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Item One</li>
  <li>Item Two</li>
  <li>Item Three</li>
</ul>
<p class="inline">I am a paragraph. A short one.</p>
<p class="inline">I am another paragraph. Also a short one.</p>
```

- The key thing to remember for now is: Changing the value of the `display` property can change wehther the outer display type of a box is block or inline. THis changes the way it displays alongside other elements in the layout

## What is the CSS box model?

- The CSS box model as a whole applies to block boxes and defines how the different parts of a box — margin, border, padding, and content — work together to create a box that you can see on a page. Inline boxes use just some of the behavior defined in the box model.
- To add complexity, there is a standard and an alternate box model. By default, browsers use the standard box model.

### Parts of a box

Making up a block box in CSS we have the:

- **Content box**: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like `inline-size` and `block-size` or `width` and `height`.
- **Padding box**: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using `padding` and related properties.
- **Border box**: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using `border` and related properties.
- **Margin box**: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using `margin` and related properties.

Here's a diagram that shows these layers:

![Standard Box Model](./assets/box-model.png)

### The Standard Box Model

- In the standard box model, if you give a box an `inline-size` and a `block-size` (or `width` and a `height`) attributes, this defines the inline-size and block-size (width and height in horizontal languages) of the _content_ box. Any padding and border is then added to those dimensions to get the total size taken up by the box (see image below).
- Example:

```
.box {
  width: 350px;
  height: 150px;
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 25px;
  border: 5px solid black;
}
```

![Standard Box Model](./assets/standard-box-model.png)

The actual space taken up by the box will be 410px wide (350 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5) and 210px high (150 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5).

### The alternative CSS box model

- In the alternative box model, any width is the width of the visible box on the page. The content area width is that width minus the width for the padding and border (see image below). No need to add up the border and padding to get the real size of the box.

- To turn on the alternative model for an element, set `box-sizing: border-box` on it:

```
.box {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

- Same as the example in the standard box model, the _actual_ space taken up by the box will be 350px in the inline direction and 150px in the block direction.
- To use the alternative box model for all of your elements (which is a common choice among developers), set the `box-sizing` property on the `<html>` element and set all other elements to inherit that value:

```
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

### Playing with box models

- The actual width will be simply determined by the surrounding sizes

```
.box {
  border: 5px solid rebeccapurple;
  background-color: lightgray;
  padding: 40px;
  margin: 40px;
  width: 300px;
  height: 150px;
}

.alternate {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 390px;
  height: 240px;
}
```

```
<div class="box">I use the standard box model.</div>
<div class="box alternate">I use the alternate box model.</div>
```

#### Use the browser DevTools to view the box model

- You can see the size of the element plus its margin, padding, and border.

## Margin, padding, and borders

- The properties used in the above example are **shorthands** and allow us to set all four sides of the box at once.
- These shorthands also have equivalent longhand properties, which allow control over the different sides of the box individually.

### Margin

- The margin is an invisible space around your box. It pushes other elements away from the box. Margins can have positive or negative values. Setting a negative margin on one side of your box can cause it to overlap other things on the page. Whether you are using the standard or alternative box model, the margin is always added after the size of the visible box has been calculated.
- We can control all margins of an element at once using the margin property, or each side individually using the equivalent longhand properties:
  - `margin-top`
  - `margin-right`
  - `margin-left`
  - `margin-bottom`

#### Margin collapsing

- Depending on whether two elements whose margins touch have positive or negative margins, the results will be different:
  - Two positive margins will combine to become one margin. Its size will be equal to the largest individual margin.
  - Two negative margins will collapse and the smallest (furthest from zero) value will be used.
  - If one margin is negative, its value will be subtracted from the total.
- Example:

```
.one {
  margin-bottom: 50px;
}

.two {
  margin-top: 30px;
}
```

```
<div class="container">
  <p class="one">I am paragraph one.</p>
  <p class="two">I am paragraph two.</p>
</div>
```

- The main thing to remember is that margin collapsing is a thing that happens if you are creating space with margins and don't get the space you expect.

### Borders

- The border is drawn between the margin and the padding of a box. If you are using the standard box model, the size of the border is added to the `width` and `height` of the box. If you are using the alternative box model then the size of the border makes the content box smaller as it takes up some of that available `width` and `height`.
- For styling borders, there are a large number of properties — there are four borders, and each border has a style, width, and color that we might want to manipulate.
- You can set the width, style, or color of all four borders at once using the border property.

- To set the properties of each side individually, use:
  - border-top
  - border-right
  - border-bottom
  - border-left
- To set the width, style, or color of all sides, use:

  - border-width
  - border-style
  - border-color

- The shorthand uses them in this order

### Padding

- The padding sits between the border and the content area and is used to push the content away from the border. Unlike margins, you cannot have a negative padding. Any background applied to your element will display behind the padding.
- The padding property controls the padding on all sides of an element.
- To control each side individually, use these longhand properties:
  - padding-top
  - padding-right
  - padding-bottom
  - padding-left

## The box model and inline boxes

- All of the above fully applies to block boxes. Some of the properties can apply to inline boxes too, such as those created by a `<span>` element.

```
span {
  margin: 100px;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 20px;
  height: 70px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  border: 2px solid blue;'
}
```

```
<p>
    I am a paragraph and this is a <span>span</span> inside that paragraph. A span is an inline element and so does not respect width and height.
</p>
```

### Using display: inline-block

- `display: inline-block` is a special value of `display`, which provides a middle ground between `inline` and `block`. Use it if you do not want an item to break onto a new line, but do want it to respect `width` and `height` and avoid the overlapping seen above.
- An element with display: inline-block does a subset of the block things we already know about:
  - The width and height properties are respected.
  - `padding`, `margin`, and `border` will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box.
- It does not, however, break onto a new line, and will only become larger than its content if you explicitly add `width` and `height` properties.
- Simply add the line `display: inline-block` to above the see the differences
- Where this can be useful is when you want to give a link a larger hit area by adding `padding`. `<a>` is an inline element like `<span>`; you can use `display: inline-block` to allow `padding` to be set on it, making it easier for a user to click the link.
  - You see this fairly frequently in navigation bars. The navigation below is displayed in a row using flexbox and we have added padding to the `<a>` element as we want to be able to change the `background-color` when the `<a>` is hovered. The padding appears to overlap the border on the `<ul>` element. This is because the `<a>` is an inline element.

```
.links-list a {
  background-color: rgb(179,57,81);
  color: #fff;
  text-decoration: none;
  padding: 1em 2em;
  display: inline-block;
}

.links-list a:hover {
  background-color: rgb(66, 28, 40);
  color: #fff;
}
```

```
<nav>
  <ul class="links-list">
    <li><a href="">Link one</a></li>
    <li><a href="">Link two</a></li>
    <li><a href="">Link three</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

# Background and borders

- We will take a look at the creative things you can do with CSS and backgrounds and borders. From adding gradients, background images, and rounded corners, backgrounds and borders are the answer to a lot of styling questions in CSS.

## Styling backgrounds in CSS

- The CSS background property is a shorthand for a number of background longhand properties that we will meet in this lesson. If you discover a complex background property in a stylesheet, it might seem a little hard to understand as so many values can be passed in at once.
- As seen in the following example:

```
.box {
  background: linear-gradient(
        105deg,
        rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2) 39%,
        rgba(51, 56, 57, 1) 96%
      ) center center / 400px 200px no-repeat, url(big-star.png) center
      no-repeat, rebeccapurple;
}
```

### Background colors

- The `background-color` rropety defines the background color of any element in CSS.
- The property accepts any valid `<color>`. A background-color extends underneath the content and padding box of the element.
- Example:

```
.box {
  background-color: #567895;
}

h2 {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}
span {
  background-color: rgba(255,255,255,.5);
}
```

```
<div class="box">
  <h2>Background Colors</h2>
  <p>Try changing the background <span>colors</span>.</p>
</div>
```

### Background images

- The `background-image` property enables the display of an image in the background of an element.
- In the example, there are have two boxes — one has a background image which is larger than the box (balloons.jpg), the other has a small image of a single star (star.png).
- By default, the large image is not scaled down to fit the box, so we only see a small corner of it, whereas the small image is tiled to fill the box.
- If you also specify a background color, then the image displays on top of the color.

### Controlling background-repeat

- The `background-repeat` propety is used to control the tiling behavior of images. Available values are:
  - `no-repeat` — stop the background from repeating altogether.
  - `repeat-x` — repeat horizontally.
  - `repeat-y` — repeat vertically.
  - `repeat` — the default; repeat in both directions.

### Sizing the background image

- The background image might sometimes be too large and as a result, the image will get cropped as the background. In this case, we can ues `background-size` property, which can take length of percentage values.
- You can also use keywords:
  - `cover`: the browser will make the image just large enough so that it completely covers the box area while retaining its aspect ratio. In this case, part of the image is likely to end up outside the box.
  - `contain`: the browser will make the image the right size to fit inside the box. In this case, you may end up gaps on either side or on the top and bottom of the image, if the aspect ratio of the image is different from that of the box.

### Positioning the background image

- The `background-position` property allows you to choose the position in which the background image appears on the box it is applied to. This uses a coordinate system in which the top-left-hand corner of the box is `(0,0)`, and the box is positioned along the horizontal (`x`) and vertical (`y`) axes.
- The default background-position value is `(0,0)`.
- The most common `background-position` values take two individual values — a horizontal value followed by a vertical value.
- You can use keywords such as `top` and `right`, or length and percentages to achieve the same thing, and you can also mix them up

```
.box {
  background-image: url(star.png);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: 20px top;
}
```

- You can also use a 4-value syntax in order to indicate a distance from certain edges of the box: the length unit is an offset from the value that precedes it.

```
.box {
  background-image: url(star.png);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: top 20px right 10px;
}
```

- `background-position` is a shorthand for `background-position-x` and `background-position-y`, which allow you to set the different axis position values individually.

### Gradient backgrounds

- A gradient — when used for a background — acts just like an image and is also set by using the `background-image` property.
- There are many CSS gradient generators that we can use to generate the gradeent

### Multiple background images

- It is also possible to have multiple background images — you specify multiple `background-image` values in a single property value, separating each one with a comma.
- When you do this you may end up with background images overlapping each other. The backgrounds will layer with the last listed background image at the bottom of the stack, and each previous image stacking on top of the one that follows it in the code.
- The other `background-*` properties can also have comma-separated values in the same way as `background-image`:

```
background-image: url(image1.png), url(image2.png), url(image3.png),
  url(image4.png);
background-repeat: no-repeat, repeat-x, repeat;
background-position: 10px 20px, top right;
```

- Each value of the different properties will match up to the values in the same position in the other properties. Above, for example, `image1`'s `background-repeat` value will be `no-repeat`. However, what happens when different properties have different numbers of values? The answer is that the smaller numbers of values will cycle — in the above example there are four background images but only two `background-position` values. The first two position values will be applied to the first two images, then they will cycle back around again — `image3` will be given the first position value, and `image4` will be given the second position value.

### Background attachment

- Another option we have available for backgrounds is specifying how they scroll when the content scrolls. This is controlled using the `background-attachment` property, which can take the following values:
  - `scroll`: causes the element's background to scroll when the page is scrolled. If the element content is scrolled, the background does not move. In effect, the background is fixed to the same position on the page, so it scrolls as the page scrolls.
  - `fixed`: causes an element's background to be fixed to the viewport so that it doesn't scroll when the page or element content is scrolled. It will always remain in the same position on the screen.
  - `local`: fixes the background to the element it is set on, so when you scroll the element, the background scrolls with it.
- A good example of this: [background-attachment](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/styling-boxes/backgrounds/background-attachment.html)

### Using the background shorthand property

- You will often see backgrounds specified using the `background` property. This shorthand lets you set all of the different properties at once.
- If using multiple backgrounds, you need to specify all of the properties for the first background, then add your next background after a comma. In the example below we have a gradient with a size and position, then an image background with `no-repeat` and a position, then a color.
- There are a few rules that need to be followed when writing background image shorthand values, for example:
  - A `background-color` may only be specified after the final comma.
  - The value of `background-size` may only be included immediately after `background-position`, separated with the '/' character, like this: `center/80%`.

```
.box {
  background:
    linear-gradient(105deg, rgba(255,255,255,.2) 39%, rgba(51,56,57,1) 96%) center center / 400px 200px no-repeat,
url(big-star.png) center no-repeat,
    rebeccapurple;
}
```

```
<div class="box"></div>
```

### Accessibility considerations with backgrounds

- When placing text on top of a background image or color, you should take care that you have enough contrast for the text to be legible for your visitors. If specifying an image, and if text will be placed on top of that image, you should also specify a `background-color` that will allow the text to be legible if the image does not load.
- Screen readers cannot parse background images; therefore, they should be purely decoration. Any important content should be part of the HTML page and not contained in a background.

## Borders

- When learning about the Box Model, we discovered how borders affect the size of our box. In this lesson we will look at how to use borders creatively. Typically when we add borders to an element with CSS we use a shorthand property that sets the color, width, and style of the border in one line of CSS.
- We can set a border for all four sides of a box with `border`:

```
.box {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

- Or we can target one edge of the box, for example:

```
.box {
  border-top: 1px solid black;
}
```

- The individual properties for these shorthands would be:

```
.box {
  border-width: 1px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: black;
}
```

- And the longhands:

```
.box {
  border-top-width: 1px;
  border-top-style: solid;
  border-top-color: black;
}
```

### Rounded corners

- Rounding corners on a box is achieved by using the border-radius property and associated longhands which relate to each corner of the box. Two lengths or percentages may be used as a value, the first value defining the horizontal radius, and the second the vertical radius. In a lot of cases, you will only pass in one value, which will be used for both.
- For example, to make all four corners of a box have a 10px radius:

```
.box {
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

- Or to make the top right corner have a horizontal radius of 1em, and a vertical radius of 10%:

```
.box {
  border-top-right-radius: 1em 10%;
}
```

# Handling different text directions

- Many of the properties and values that we have encountered so far in our CSS learning have been tied to the physical dimensions of our screen. We create borders on the top, right, bottom, and left of a box, for example. These physical dimensions map very neatly to content that is viewed horizontally, and by default the web tends to support left-to-right languages (e.g. English or French) better than right-to-left languages (such as Arabic).
- In recent years however, CSS has evolved in order to better support different directionality of content, including right-to-left but also top-to-bottom content (such as Japanese) — these different directionalities are called **writing modes**.

## What are writing modes?

- A writing mode in CSS refers to whether the text is running horizontally or vertically. The `writing-mode` property lets us switch from one writing mode to another. You don't need to be working in a language which uses a vertical writing mode to want to do this — you could also change the writing mode of parts of your layout for creative purposes.
- Here's an example of text running vertically:

```
h1 {
  writing-mode: vertical-rl;
}
```

```
<h1>Play with writing modes</h1>
```

- The three possible values for writing modes are:
  - `horizontal-tb`: Top-to-bottom block flow direction. Sentences run horizontally.
  - `vertical-rl`: Right-to-left block flow direction. Sentences run vertically.
  - `vertical-lr`: Left-to-right block flow direction. Sentences run vertically.

## Writing modes and block and inline layout

- Block and inline styles are tied to the writing mode of the document, and not the physical screen. Blocks are only displayed from the top to the bottom of the page if you are using a writing mode that displays text horizontally, such as English.
- When we switch the writing mode, we are changing which direction is block and which is inline. In a `horizontal-tb` writing mode the block direction runs from top to bottom; in a `vertical-rl` writing mode the block direction runs right-to-left horizontally. So the **block dimension** is always the direction blocks are displayed on the page in the writing mode in use. The **inline dimension** is always the direction a sentence flows.
- This figure shows the two dimensions in a horizontal writing mode:

![horizontal](./assets/horizontal-tb.png)

- This figure shows the two dimensions in a vertical writing mode:

![vertical](./assets/vertical.png)

### Direction

- In addition to writing mode we also have text direction. As mentioned above, some languages such as Arabic are written horizontally, but right-to-left. This is not something you are likely to use in a creative sense — if you want to line something up on the right there are other ways to do so — however it is important to understand this as part of the nature of CSS. The web is not just for languages that are displayed left-to-right!
- Due to the fact that writing mode and direction of text can change, newer CSS layout methods do not refer to left and right, and top and bottom. Instead they will talk about start and end along with this idea of inline and block. Don't worry too much about that right now, but keep these ideas in mind as you start to look at layout; you will find it really helpful in your understanding of CSS.

## Logical properties and values

- The reason to talk about writing modes and direction at this point in your learning is that we have already looked at a lot of properties that are tied to the physical dimensions of the screen, and these make more sense when in a horizontal writing mode.
- In the following example, you will see that the vertical width is not wide enough and causes the text to overflow:

```
.box {
  width: 150px;
}

.horizontal {
  writing-mode: horizontal-tb;
}

.vertical {
  writing-mode: vertical-rl;
}
```

```
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="box horizontal">
    <h2>Heading</h2>
    <p>A paragraph. Demonstrating Writing Modes in CSS.</p>
    <p>These boxes have a width.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box vertical">
    <h2>Heading</h2>
    <p>A paragraph. Demonstrating Writing Modes in CSS.</p>
    <p>These boxes have a width.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

- What we really want in this scenario is to essentially swap height with width in accordance to the writing mode. When we're in a vertical writing mode we want the box to expand in the block dimension just like it does in the horizontal mode.
- To make this easier, CSS has recently developed a set of mapped properties. These essentially replace physical properties — things like `width` and `height` — with logical, or flow relative versions.
- The property mapped to width when in a horizontal writing mode is called `inline-size` — it refers to the size in the inline dimension. The property for height is named `block-size` and is the size in the block dimension. You can see how this works in the example below where we have replaced `width` with `inline-size`:

```
.box {
  inline-size: 150px;
}

.horizontal {
  writing-mode: horizontal-tb;
}

.vertical {
  writing-mode: vertical-rl;
}
```

### Logical margin, border, and padding properties

- In the same way that we have mappings for width and height there are mappings for these properties.
- The margin-top property is mapped to `margin-block-start` — this will always refer to the margin at the start of the block dimension.
- The `padding-left` property maps to `padding-inline-start`, the padding that is applied to the start of the inline direction. This will be where sentences start in that writing mode. The `border-bottom` property maps to `border-block-end`, which is the border at the end of the block dimension.
- You can see a comparison between physical and logical properties below:
  - Specifically: **If you change the writing mode of the boxes by switching the `writing-mode` property on `.box` to `vertical-rl`, you will see how the physical properties stay tied to their physical direction, whereas the logical properties switch with the writing mode.**

### Logical values

- We have so far looked at logical property names. There are also some properties that take physical values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`. These values also have mappings, to logical values — `block-start`, `inline-end`, `block-end`, and `inline-start`.

### Should you use physical or logical values?

- The logical properties and values are newer than their physical equivalents, and therefore have only recently been implemented in browsers. You can check any property page on MDN to see how far back the browser support goes. If you are not using multiple writing modes then for now you might prefer to use the physical versions. However, ultimately we expect that people will transition to the logical versions for most things, as they make a lot of sense once you start also dealing with layout methods such as flexbox and grid.

# Overflowing content

- Overflow is what happens when there is too much content to fit in a container.
